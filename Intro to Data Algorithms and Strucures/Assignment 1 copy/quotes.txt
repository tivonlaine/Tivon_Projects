"There is nothing like looking, if you want to find something. 
You certainly usually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you were after."

"Among the tales of sorrow and of ruin that came down to us from the darkness of those days 
there are yet some in which amid weeping there is joy and under the shadow of death light that endures. 
And of these histories, most fair still in the ears of the Elves is the tale of Beren and LÃºthien."

"I wish it need not have happened in my time," said Frodo.
"So do I," said Gandalf, "and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."

"The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair,

"It's like in the great stories. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. 
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end... because how could the end be happy? 
How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? 
But in the end, it's only a passing thing... this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come."

"How do you go on, when in your heart you begin to understand... there is no going back? 
There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep."
